# SnapCore

SnapCore is a social media-inspired web application themed around Mastodon, Instagram, and TikTok (MastoInstaTok), designed to demonstrate the use of non-relational databases. The project is built with a TypeScript backend (Node.js/Express) and a TypeScript-based web frontend framework React. **No SQL/relational databases are used**â€”all data is managed with scalable, modern NoSQL solutions.

## Features

- User registration and authentication
- Posting images, videos, and short messages
- Feed/timeline displaying recent posts
- Like and comment functionality
- Explore trending content

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** TypeScript (Node.js/Express)

- **Databases:** Non-relational only (e.g., MongoDB Atlas, DynamoDB, Redis, etc.)

## Database Choices

- **MongoDB (Document Store):** For storing user profiles, posts, and comments
- **Neo4j (Graphs):** For storing users, follower/following and likes
